# Regex Crossword Goodies

This is a Google Chrome Extension that provides a set of enhancements for the http://regexcrossword.com/ website.

## Functionality

* **Load/Save Puzzles** - you can copy/paste a textual representation of the current solution in order to resume it later.
* **Regex Validation** - as soon as you complete a row/column, the corresponding regex clues are automatically validated and their status is shown in red or green. This also works for the newly introduced hexagonal puzzles.
* **Player Puzzle List Filter** - (only for authenticated users) - allows you to filter toggle between showing the entire puzzle list, or just the unsolved unambiguous puzzles available.
 
Have fun playing this awesome game!
