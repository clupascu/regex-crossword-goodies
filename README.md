# Regex Crossword Goodies

This project contains a set of enhancements for the http://regexcrossword.com/ website.

## Functionality

* **Load/Save Puzzles** - you can copy/paste a textual representation of the current solution in order to resume it later.
* **Show Errors** - performs a client-side validation of your solution against the REGEX expressions and shows the results (*note: it only validates complete rows/columns!*)

## How to run

* Copy the Javascript code and paste it into the browser's JS console

-or-

* Run the code as a [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)

Both actions are valid only in the context of a page containing a puzzle to solve.

I might turn this into a Chrome Extension in the future. 

 
## Browser support

The code has been tested in Google Chrome 40 and Mozilla Firefox 35.
